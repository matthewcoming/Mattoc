during vmware-tools install in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS you might run into a loop where it will prompt you to give the location of your ifconfig file.

in order to find the location of it, do the following:

$ sudo apt install mlocate
$ sudo updatedb
$ sudo mlocate ifconfig

output should look like usr/src/linux-headers-x.xx.x-xx/tools/hv/hv_set_ifconfig.sh
