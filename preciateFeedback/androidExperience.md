# Preciate SMS & Android Experience
---
#### User's first impression

Going forward, 'Mike' refers to an iOS user that is using the Preciate app, and 'User' refers to an android user that is interacting with the automated SMS service.

| ![fail url][initRecog.jpg] | ![failed url][firstClickLink.jpg]
| :---: 	| :---:
|Mike Coming recognizes an android user. | SMS user clicks link given.


* The initial message might read better as "Hi there. Mike Coming recognized you for **being** "Always On Target" **with** Preciate."
    * **'being'** is grammatically needed as the verb, but would not be included for messages such as "Leading the charge" and "Guiding the way". Given that this is the very first impression a user has with Preciate, the broken sentence fragment ...recognized you for "Always On Target" on Preciate... might confuse them.

* **'with'** implies that Preciate is more of a tool to use, rather than a place to be.

* The next messages states that the user should use the Preciate app to send recognition, but non-iOS users must use the browser to send recognition.
    * This is not clear, though, for any android user who doesn't search through the website.

* Depending on the android device, the user might be using the device-standard and unchangeable browser, such as Samsung Internet for Samsung devices. This may or may not affect user experience until an android app is created.

| :---: | :---:
|Mike recognizes the user with a message. | The user accepts the message.



| ![failed url][crazyWaysRecog.jpg] | ![failed url][declineCrazyWays.jpg]
| :---: | :---:
| Mike recognizes the user.| The user declines. 



| ![failed url][helpSms.jpg]
| :---:
| The user sends 'Help' and receives  information on how to unsubscribe.

* Although ugly, it might be required by the US E-SIGN act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act(TCPA), and the Cellular Telephone Industries Association(CTIA) that this message not only appear on a specific user input.



| ![failed url][smsProfileLink.jpg](cropped for privacy) | ![failed url][myProfile.jpg]
| :---: | :---:
| Mike sends the user a link to the users profile.| User clicks the link. 

* The user has no apparent way of accessing their profile through the website.
* The user does not know that a public profile was created on initial recognition. A link to their profile would help.
* Mike linked a phone number to the Name 'Matthew Coming' and created this profile. How could an android user take control of the account other than emailing for its deletion?



| ![failed url][totallyAwesome.jpg] | ![failed url][acceptTotallyAwesome.jpg]
| :---: | :---:
| Mike sends the user recognition "Always on Target".| Mike had also sent recognition "Going the Distance" at the same time. 

* Mike sent the user two recognitions, one shortly after the other. The user waited several minutes after receiving the first message reporting recognition before accepting it. Immediately after, the user was prompted to accept the second recognition.



| ![failed url][profileRecognitionNew.jpg] | ![failed url][profileAchievementNew.jpg]
| :---: | :---:
| Recognition page of user's profile | Achievement page of user profile 

* After viewing the profile page, it becomes apparent that the user replying "no" to "accept Mike's recognition" was not in fact declining the recognition, rather just whether or not the message would be displayed with the recognition.

* What happens with respect to the profile page when Mike sends the user recognition with a message that the user has no accepted?


| ![failed url][filledRecognition.jpg] | ![failed url][responseRecognition.jpg]

* User doesn't have the ability to send more than one recognition over the website without reloading the web page.
* Considering the app requires a user name or a persons name with a phone number, an android user using this web page to send recognition, with only an actual name and receiving a bare-bones 'thank you' response, ought to suspect something is odd about this process.


#### Website bug mobile & desktop

* Odd background behavior on Relation Wealth page https://preciate.org/relational-wealth. Green diamond appears suddenly and then floats into top of screen.
