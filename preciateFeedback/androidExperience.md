# Preciate SMS & Android Experience
---
#### User's first impression
| ![fail url][initRecog.jpg] | ![failed url][firstClickLink.jpg]
| :---: 	| :---:
|Mike Coming recognizes an android user. | SMS user clicks link given.


* The initial message might read better as "Hi there. Mike Coming recognized you for **being** "Always On Target" **with** Preciate."
    * **'being'** is gramatically needed as the verb, but would not be included for messages such as "Leading the charge" and "Guiding the way".<br><br> Given that this is the first impression a user has with Preciate, the broken sentence fragment ...recognized you for "Always On Target" on Preciate... might confuse them.
<br>
* **'with'** implies that Preciate is more of a tool to use, rather than a place to be.

* The next messages states that the user should use the Preciate app to send recognition, but non-iOS users must use the browser to send recognition.
    * This is not clear, though, for any android user who doesn't search through the website.

* Depending on the android device, the user might be using the device-standard and unchangeable browser, such as Samsung Internet for Samsung devices. This may or may not affect user experience until an android app is created.

|Mike recognizes an android user <br> with the message "Matthew is a fine <br> son". The user has the ability to accept<br> this message. | The user accepts.

| Mike recognizes the user.| The user declines. 

<br>

| ![failed url][helpSms.jpg]
| :---:
| The user sends 'Help' and recieves <br> information on how to unsubscribe.

* Although ugly, it might be required by the US E-SIGN act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act(TCPA), and the Cellular Telephone Industries Association(CTIA) that this message only appear on a specific user input.

<br>

| ![failed url][smsProfileLink.jpg]<br>(cropped for privacy) | ![failed url][myProfile.jpg]
| :---: | :---:
| Mike sends the user a link to <br>the users profile.| User clicks the link. 

* The user has no apparent way of accessing their profile through the website.
* The user does not know that a public profile was created on initial recognition. A link to their profile would help.
* Mike linked a phone number to the Name 'Matthew Coming' and created this profile. How could an android user take control of the account other than emailing for its deletion?
