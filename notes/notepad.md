Consider asking, 'Do we need this person to explain this?' This is not to say that, if confronted with an opinion you do not share, you can dismiss it with "I don't need this person to explain this to me, I understand it".

A students work for C students, and neither mind.

The best way to learn something is to be wrong, multiple times.

We don't get very many asteroids these days.
